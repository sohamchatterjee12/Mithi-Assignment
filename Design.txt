I am using 3 classes in total. The Index class is used for reading each page line by line and storing the occurrences of words in a map. The Exclude class is used for storing the words to be excluded in a set and returning it to the main function. Lastly, the BookIndexer class contains our main function which loads the pages from args and passes them to the respective classes for processing. Finally it prints the output to a file index.txt.
